## Bio

I'm a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research where I lead the Social, Behavioral, and Economic COVID-19 Coordinating Center [(SBE CCC)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/sbeccc/). My research focuses on respiratory viruses particularly SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the social, biological, and environmental drivers of severe respiratory illness associated with these pathogens.
